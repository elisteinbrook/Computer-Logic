//Question: You have been tasked with reviewing and updating this program. What steps would you take to identify any issues in the code?
//Your Response: Look through declarations, conditional statement, and through while loop

//Question: What actions could the developer have taken to minimize the number of errors?
//Your Response: Possibly modularization if it is a program that could be modularized. Follow the testing plan.

//Debbugging Exercise:

// This pseudocode is intended to determine whether students have
// passed or failed a course; student needs to average 60 or
// more on two tests.
